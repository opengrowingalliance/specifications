# OGP Core Specification (v2.0)

*This document is part of the OGP 2.0 specification suite. For the overarching vision, motivation, and community-driven approach, please refer to the [Root Specification](../ogp-root-spec.md).*

**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Date:** March 19, 2025  
**Status:** Proposed Standard  
**Authors:** Open Growing Alliance  

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

This Core Specification defines the technical architecture and implementation requirements of the Open Growing Protocol (OGP). It serves as the technical foundation that unifies all domain-specific specifications and provides a comprehensive framework for implementing interoperable growing systems.

The scope of this document includes:
- Defining the core technical architecture of OGP-compliant systems
- Establishing the technical relationships between all domain specifications
- Providing detailed technical guidance for implementers
- Specifying the minimum requirements for OGP compliance
- Outlining the extension mechanisms for future capabilities

This specification is intended for hardware manufacturers, software developers, system integrators, and other technical stakeholders implementing OGP-compliant systems.

### 1.2 Key Concepts

The OGP is built on several fundamental concepts that enable interoperability, extensibility, and security across implementations:

**Interoperability**: The ability for components from different manufacturers to work together seamlessly. This is achieved through standardized interfaces, data formats, and communication protocols. Interoperability is the cornerstone of the OGP, enabling recipe portability and component substitutability.

**Extensibility**: The capacity for the protocol to accommodate new capabilities, technologies, and use cases without breaking existing implementations. Extensibility is built into the OGP through modular design, versioned interfaces, and explicit extension points.

**Security by Design**: Security is integrated into every aspect of the OGP, not added as an afterthought. This includes authentication, authorization, data protection, and secure communication channels. The security model is designed to protect both the growing system and the data it generates.

**Progressive Enhancement**: Basic functionality works everywhere, with enhanced capabilities available where supported. This allows for implementations at various resource levels while maintaining compatibility.

**Declarative Approach**: Recipes describe what to achieve, not how to achieve it, allowing for implementation flexibility across different hardware configurations.

### 1.3 Relationship to Domain Specifications

The Core Specification serves as the technical foundation for all domain-specific specifications. It defines the common architecture, data models, and interaction patterns that enable the domains to work together as a cohesive system.

The relationship between the Core Specification and domain specifications is illustrated in the following diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Root[Root Specification] --> Core[Core Specification]
    Root --> Recipe[Recipe Specification]

    Recipe --> AI
    
    Hardware --> Comm
    Hardware --> Security
    
    AI --> Comm
    
    Comm --> Security
```

Each specification has clear dependencies and relationships with others, creating a cohesive whole while maintaining modularity.

- **Recipe Specification**: Defines the format and structure for growing recipes, depending on hardware capabilities and potentially AI features.
- **Hardware Specification**: Details the hardware abstraction layer, relying on communication protocols and security measures.
- **Communication Specification**: Specifies the communication standards and protocols, with security considerations.
- **AI Integration Specification**: Outlines the AI model interfaces and capabilities, utilizing communication protocols.
- **Security Specification**: Provides security standards and best practices that apply across all domains.

Implementers must adhere to both the Core Specification and the relevant domain specifications for their specific implementation.

### 1.4 Versioning and Compatibility

The OGP follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) with the following guidelines:

- **MAJOR** version changes indicate incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version changes add functionality in a backward-compatible manner
- **PATCH** version changes make backward-compatible bug fixes

The Core Specification and each domain specification are versioned independently, allowing for different evolution rates while maintaining overall coherence.

**Backward Compatibility Requirements:**

1. New MINOR versions MUST be backward compatible with previous MINOR versions of the same MAJOR version.
2. Implementations MUST clearly indicate their supported specification versions.
3. Features marked as "deprecated" MAY be removed in the next MAJOR version.
4. Implementations SHOULD support at least the current and previous MAJOR versions.

**Version Discovery:**

Systems MUST provide a version discovery endpoint that returns:
- Supported specification versions (Core and domain-specific)
- Implementation-specific version information
- Capability matrix indicating supported optional features
- Deprecation notices for features scheduled for removal

This versioning strategy ensures that implementations can evolve while maintaining compatibility with existing systems and recipes.

## 2. Architecture Overview

### 5.3 Versioning Policy

The OGP follows a structured versioning policy:

**Versioning Scheme**:
- **MAJOR**: Incompatible changes that require implementation updates
- **MINOR**: New features that maintain backward compatibility
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes and clarifications that maintain backward compatibility

**Version Lifecycle**:
1. **Draft**: Initial development version, subject to significant changes
2. **Proposed Standard**: Stable version ready for implementation
3. **Standard**: Widely implemented and validated version
4. **Deprecated**: Version scheduled for removal in a future MAJOR release
5. **Retired**: Version no longer supported

**Version Transition Rules**:
1. Draft versions MAY change without notice
2. Proposed Standard versions MUST maintain backward compatibility for MINOR and PATCH changes
3. Standard versions MUST maintain backward compatibility for MINOR and PATCH changes
4. Deprecated versions MUST be supported for at least one MAJOR version cycle
5. Retired versions MAY be removed from reference implementations

**Version Documentation**:
- Each version MUST be clearly documented
- Changes between versions MUST be documented in a changelog
- Migration guides MUST be provided for MAJOR version changes
- Deprecation notices MUST include migration guidance

### 5.4 Deprecation Process

The OGP follows a structured deprecation process to ensure smooth transitions:

**Deprecation Stages**:
1. **Announcement**: Feature is marked as deprecated but fully functional
2. **Warning**: Runtime warnings are issued when deprecated features are used
3. **Removal**: Feature is removed in a MAJOR version update

**Deprecation Timeline**:
- Features MUST be deprecated for at least one MINOR version before removal
- Deprecated features MUST be documented in the specification
- Implementations MUST provide warnings when deprecated features are used
- Removal MUST only occur in MAJOR version updates

**Deprecation Documentation**:
- Clear explanation of why the feature is being deprecated
- Recommended alternatives or migration paths
- Timeline for warning implementation and eventual removal
- Impact assessment for different types of implementations

**Backward Compatibility**:
- Deprecated features MUST continue to function until removal
- New features SHOULD NOT depend on deprecated features
- Migration tools SHOULD be provided where appropriate
- Compatibility layers MAY be provided to ease transition
