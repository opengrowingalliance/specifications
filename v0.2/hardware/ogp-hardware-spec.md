## Hardware Abstraction Layer

### Key Aspects
The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) provides a standardized interface for sensors and actuators, allowing recipes to work across different hardware implementations. Key aspects include:
1. Device discovery and capability advertisement
2. Standardized command structures
3. Error handling and reporting
4. Calibration procedures
5. Maintenance status reporting
